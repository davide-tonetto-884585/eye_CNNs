# Eye and Iris Recognition with TensorFlow

This repository contains Python code for a simple project that implements neural networks for eye and iris recognition, utilizing TensorFlow.

## Features

- **Eye and Iris Recognition:** The model can accurately identify and distinguish between different eyes and irises.
- **Deep Learning:** Built on TensorFlow, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification.

## Model Architecture

The model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and a Recurrent CNN, specifically designed for feature extraction from eye images. Those includes:

- **Convolutional Layers:** For spatial feature extraction.
- **Max Pooling Layers:** For dimensionality reduction.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** For classification and regression tasks.
- **Output Layer:** For predicting the eye and iris coordinates.

## Dataset

This project does not include a dataset due to privacy concerns. You can use publicly available datasets such as [CASIA-IrisV4](http://biometrics.idealtest.org/) or create your own dataset using a camera.
